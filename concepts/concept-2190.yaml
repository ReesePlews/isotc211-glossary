  notes:
  - For PolSAR sensor, if the transmitting channel is horizontally (H) polarized,
    the cross-talk on transmitting defines the ratio of V polarization transmitting
    power to H polarization transmitting power, expressed in decibels (dB). The cross-talk
    on receiving is similar to that on transmitting.
