  notes:
  - $[\forall a \in A \implies min(A) \leq a] \implies [\forall b \ni [(b \ni [\forall
    a \in A \implies b \leq a] \implies [min(A) \geq b]]$ Any number is a lower bound
    of $\emptyset$ considered as a set of numbers, because any given number is less
    than any number in $\emptyset$ (an admitted vacuous statement since there is no
    number in $\emptyset$, but true nonetheless). This means that the $min(\emptyset)$
    must be greater than any number; this "$+\infty$".
