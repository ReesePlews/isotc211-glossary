  term: radar cross section
  definition: measure of the capability of the object to scatter the transmitted radar
    power
  language_code: eng
  notes:
  - Radar cross section is calculated as `sigma = lim_(R ->oo) 4 pi R^2 (abs(E_s)^2)
    / (abs(E_i)^2)` where `sigma` is the radar cross section; `E_i` is the electric-field
    strength of the incident wave; `E_s` is the electric-field strength of the scattered
    wave at the radar with a distance `R` away from the target.
  - "Â 2 to entry: Radar cross section has the dimensions of area, with the unit of
    square metres. Usually, it is expressed in the form of a logarithm with the unit
    of dBsm as follows `sigma_(dBsm) = 10 log_(10) sigma`"
