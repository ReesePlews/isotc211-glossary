  term: tangent <differential geometry, calculus>
  definition: direction indicating the instantaneous direction of a curve at a point
  language_code: eng
  notes:
  - The tangent is usually calculated by differentiation of a functional representation
    of a curve but it may be approximated by a secant (double intersection) line from
    the point passing through another nearby point on the curve. The closer the second
    point is to the first, the better the approximation of the tangent's direction.
