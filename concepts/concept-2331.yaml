  - In most cases, the vertical reference frame will be related to mean sea level.
    Vertical datums include sounding datums (used for hydrographic purposes), in which

  - Ellipsoidal heights are related to a three-dimensional ellipsoidal coordinate
    system referenced to a geodetic reference frame.
