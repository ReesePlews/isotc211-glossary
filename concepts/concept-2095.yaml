  definition: first derivative of a curve parameterized by arc length
  language_code: eng
  notes:
  - If $c(s)=(x(s),y(s),z(s))$ is a curve in a 3D Cartesian space $(\mathbb{E}^3)$,
    and $s$ is arc length along $c$, then the tangent is $\vec \tau(s) = \dot c(s)
    = (\dot x(s), \dot y(s), \dot z(s))$, i.e. the derivative of the coordinate values
    of $c$ with respect to $s$. The curvature vector is $ \kappa(s) = \ddot c(s) =
    (\ddot x(s), \ddot y(s), \ddot z(s))$.
