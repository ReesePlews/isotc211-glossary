  notes:
  - The abstract concept of a TRS is realised through a terrestrial reference frame
    that usually consists of a set of physical points with precisely determined coordinates
    and optionally their rates of change. In this document terrestrial reference frame
    is included within the geodetic reference frame element of the data model.
