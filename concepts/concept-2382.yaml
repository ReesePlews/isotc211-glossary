  term: ellipsoid <geodesy>
  definition: geometric reference surface embedded in 3D Euclidean space represented
    by an ellipsoid of revolution where the rotation is about the polar axis
  language_code: eng
  notes:
  - For the Earth the rotation is about the polar axis. This results in an oblate
    ellipsoid with midpoint of the foci located at the nominal centre of the Earth.
  - The two usual algorithms for latitude on an ellipsoid and on a sphere (such as
    used in spherical coordinates) are only equivalent if the ellipsoid is a sphere,
    having all radii equal in all directions. The problem is that a radial line from
    the centre of a general ellipsoid does not always cross the surface of the ellipsoid
    orthogonally. In general, planar slices through the centre do not intersect the
    surface orthogonally, and therefore the curves that correspond to the great circles
    of a sphere are not geodesics on the ellipsoid.
  - "The topology of the ellipsoid is inherited from the \U0001D53C3 space in which
    it is embedded. The difference is that metrics such as distance and direction
    on the ellipsoid are restricted to curves wholly on the surface and vectors tangent
    to the surface.at"
